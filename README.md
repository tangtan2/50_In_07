# 50_in_07: Hockey Prediction Model

This project is an attempt at predicting game events using historical data and machine learning. Prototype models can be found [here](https://github.com/tangtan2/50_in_07/tree/master/src/proto_models) and a characterization of raw data used as inputs can be found [here](https://github.com/tangtan2/50_in_07/blob/master/data/analytics/data_characterization.ipynb).

**NOTE: this code represents prototype work and will be completely erased in the next commit**
